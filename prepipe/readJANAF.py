# =============================================================================
# This code makes the thermo_dir (default: 'gdata') directory that carries 
# converted JANAF tables with the information needed for TEA to run: 
# ['T (K)', '-[G-H(Tr)]/T (J/K/mol)', 'delta-f H (kJ/mol)']. 
#
# The code also makes conversion_record.txt that gives the names of the 
# original, the raw JANAF files and the new names given by the readJANAF.py. 
# To sort the file list in alphabetical order, execute in terminal: 
# sort conversion_record.txt >conversion_record_sorted.txt
#
# The names of the files have the following format:
# 1. Each converted file carries a unique name and state given by the top
#    line in each JANAF file.
# 2. If a species appears just once in the JANAF tables, it gets a unique name
#    of the compound and its state and is defined as 'originals' in the code 
#    (example: CH4_g).
# 3. If a species appears several times, it is defined as 'redundant' in the 
#    code and an additional string is added to differentiate among them. 
#    (example: Al2O3_cr_Alpha, Al2O3_cr_Beta, Al2O3_cr_Kappa).
# 4. If a species is an ion, additional string is added
#    (example: Al-007.txt and Al-008.txt became Al_ion_n_g, Al_ion_p_g)
#
# The setup of this code is made in prepipe.py inside the setup() function.
# The code retrieves pre-pipeline setup information, creates a directory for 
# converted thermodynamic files, checks whether a species is redundant in the
# JANAF tables, and creates conversion_record.txt. If a species is redundant,
# an additional string is added to the file name. The module loops over all 
# JANAF tables and writes data into the correct columns with the correct 
# labels.
#
# The prepipe.py code can execute this code together with the readJANAF.py. 
# readJANAF.py can also be executed on its own with the simple command: 
# readJANAF.py.
