# =============================================================================
# This code makes the stoich_out file (default: stoich.txt) that carries
# stoichiometric values of all species that appear in the JANAF tables. It
# creates a temporary directory where the JANAF tables are converted into
# stoichiometric tables. They carry a unique  name and state, given by the top
# line in each JANAF table:
# (i.e., original JANAF table "Al-001.txt" is converted to "Al_ref.txt").  
# If desired, user can  preserve this directory (in TEA.cfg, doprint = True). 
#
# The names of the files in the temporary directory have the following format:
# 1. If a species appears just once in the JANAF tables, it gets a unique name 
#    of the compound and its state and is defined as 'originals' in the code 
#    (example: CH4_g).
# 2. If a species appears several times, it is defined as 'redundant' in the 
#    code and an additional string is added to differentiate among them. 
#    (example: Al2O3_cr_Alpha, Al2O3_cr_Beta, Al2O3_cr_Kappa).
#
# The setup of this code is made in prepipe.py inside setup().
# The code retrieves the setup information, creates a temporary directory to 
# store the converted files, allocates space for these files with a unique, 
# original names and files with redundant names, then loops over all JANAF 
# tables to write stoichiometric files. 
#
# To write the stoich_out file (default: stoich.txt), it again loops over all
# elements (listed in comp() inside prepipe.py) and matches them with the
# abundance data from abun_file (default: abundances.txt). If a match is not
# found, the abundance is set to zero. This information is written at the top 
# of the stoich_out file. 
#
# For each species in the JANAF tables and elements in comp(), the species name
# and stoichiometric values are written into the stoich_out file. The code
# ignores redundant compounds as they carry the same stoichiometric values.
#
# The prepipe.py code can execute the this code together with the readJANAF.py. 
# makestoich.py can also be executed on its own with the simple command: 
# makestoich.py.
