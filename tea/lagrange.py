def lagrange(it_num, datadir, doprint, direct):
    '''
    This code applies Lagrange's method and calculates minimum based on the 
    methodology elaborated in the TEA theory document in Section (3). Equations in
    this code contain both references and an explicitly written definitions.
    The program reads the last iteration's output and data from the last header
    file, creates variables for the Lagrange equations, sets up the Lagrange
    equations, and calculates final x_i mole numbers for the current iteration 
    cycle. Note that the mole numbers that result from this function are 
    allowed to be negative. If negatives are returned, lambda correction 
    (lambdacorr.py) is necessary. The final x_i values, as well as x_bar, 
    y_bar, delta, and delta_bar are written into machine- and human-readable
    output files. This function is executed by iterate.py.

    Parameters
    ----------
    it_num:  integer 
             Iteration number.
    datadir: string
             Current directory where TEA is run.
    doprint: string
             Parameter in configuration file that allows printing for 
             debugging purposes.
    direct:  object
             Object containing all of the results/data from the previous
             calculation in lagrange.py or lambdacorr.py. It is a list
             containing current header directory, current iteration 
             number, array of species names, array of initial guess, 
             array of non-corrected Lagrange values, and array of 
             lambdacorr corrected values.

    Returns
    -------
    header: string
            Name of the header file used.
    it_num: integer 
            Iteration number.
    speclist: string array
            Array containing names of molecular species. 
    y: float array
            Array containing initial guess of molecular species for
            current iteration.
    x: float array
            Array containing final mole numbers of molecular species for
            current iteration.
    delta: float array
            Array containing change in initial and final mole numbers of
            molecular species for current iteration.
    y_bar: float
            Array containing total sum of initial guesses of all molecular 
            species for current iteration.
    x_bar: float
            Total sum of the final mole numbers of all molecular species.
    delta_bar: float 
            Change in total of initial and final mole numbers of molecular
            species.
