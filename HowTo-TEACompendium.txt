This file contains instructions how to properly make a TEA compendium.

When downloading TEA, you agreed that you will provide all references
(software, data, and publication) for reproducing the research done
using TEA.

To make a compendium, you can use github or similar websites, like
Victoria Stodden's http://researchcompendia.org/, that serve the same
purposes.

The information once uploaded should never be taken down!

1. If original TEA version is not changed do the following:
   - give link to your publication that uses TEA
   - fork, upload or link the TEA version used to produce your results
   - make ReadMe file and explain for what purposes TEA has been used
   - make directory for each figure and table from your publication and
     provide any additional material to reproduce the results
   - make ReadMe file for each figure and table and explain how to 
     reproduce the results

2. If original TEA version has been changed do the following:
   - give link to your publication that uses TEA
   - fork/upload or link the TEA version you used
   - commit the changes you did on the code
   - make ReadMe file and explain:
               - all changes that has been done to the code
               - what steps need to be taken to reproduce the results
   - upload additional material used to produce your results

Our recommendation is to produce the compendium as you go!

The purpose of making a compendium is to:
- archive your research (data, codes, documentation, parameters, publication)
- track computational changes
- get appropriate credit for your code in addition to publications
- allow others to reproduce, verify, and validate scientific results
- allow others to build on your work
- provide ability to use the latest scientific methods

The github repo https://github.com/dzesmin/RRC-BlecicEtal-2015a-ApJS-TEA, 
contains an example how to properly make a compendium. This directory 
collects the source files, data, codes, and instructions how to 
reproduce all the figures and tables from the Blecic et al. (2015a), 
"TEA: A code for calculating thermochemical equilibrium abundances", paper.
